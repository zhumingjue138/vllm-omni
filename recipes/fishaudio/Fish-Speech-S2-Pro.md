# Fish Speech S2 Pro

> Online serving for TTS

## Summary

- Vendor: FishAudio
- Model: `fishaudio/s2-pro`
- Task: Text-to-speech synthesis with optional voice cloning
- Mode: Online serving with the OpenAI-compatible `/v1/audio/speech` API
- Maintainer: Community

## When to use this recipe

Use this recipe as a practical baseline for running `fishaudio/s2-pro` for
high-quality text-to-speech synthesis. Fish Speech S2 Pro outputs 44.1 kHz
audio and supports voice cloning from reference audio.

## Hardware Support

This recipe documents reference GPU configuration for Fish Speech S2 Pro.
Other hardware and configurations are welcome as community validation lands.

## GPU

### 1x A800 80GB

#### Environment

- OS: Linux
- Python: 3.10+
- CUDA 12.8
- vLLM version: 0.19.0
- vLLM-Omni version or commit: c93359bb354a6aa5c14d062430cb85b2c4db251e

No extra packages are required: the DAC codec architecture is vendored in
vLLM-Omni (`vllm_omni/model_executor/models/fish_speech/dac_modules/`), so the
model runs out of the box, including in the official Docker image.

#### Kvcache attention fast path

Fish Speech S2 Pro uses a Triton decode-only kvcache attention fast path by
default on CUDA builds. Set `VLLM_OMNI_FISH_KVCACHE_ATTN=0` to disable it, or
`VLLM_OMNI_FISH_KVCACHE_ATTN=required` to fail fast if the fast path cannot be
installed.

```bash
# Verify fast path availability.
python - <<'PY'
from vllm_omni.attention import fish_kvcache_attn

print(fish_kvcache_attn.is_available())
print(fish_kvcache_attn.load_error())
PY

# Optional: disable the runtime fast path.
export VLLM_OMNI_FISH_KVCACHE_ATTN=0
```

#### Command

```bash
vllm serve fishaudio/s2-pro --omni --port 8091
```

Notes:

- `--omni` is required.
- The default deploy config `vllm_omni/deploy/fish_qwen3_omni.yaml` is loaded
  automatically by model registry (HF `model_type=fish_qwen3_omni`).


#### Verification

Basic TTS:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8091/v1/audio/speech \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "input": "Hello, how are you?",
        "voice": "default",
        "response_format": "wav"
    }' --output output.wav
```
[output.wav](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/27134970/output.wav)

Voice cloning:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8091/v1/audio/speech \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "input": "Hello, this is a cloned voice.",
        "voice": "default",
        "ref_audio": "https://example.com/reference.wav",
        "ref_text": "Transcript of the reference audio."
    }' --output cloned.wav
```
[reference.wav](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/27134971/reference.wav) <br>
[cloned.wav](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/27134969/cloned.wav)



#### Notes

- Key flags: `--omni` is required.
- Known limitations: Output audio is 44.1 kHz mono WAV. Voice cloning requires
  both `ref_audio` and `ref_text` parameters.
- Memory usage: Model loads at ~48.3 GiB, peaks at ~48.9 GiB during inference
  headroom for video frames and audio caches.

### 2x H100 80GB

#### Environment

- OS: Linux
- Python: 3.10+
- CUDA 12.8
- vLLM version: 0.19.0+

#### Command

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 vllm serve fishaudio/s2-pro --omni --port 8091 \
    --deploy-config vllm_omni/deploy/fish_qwen3_omni_2gpu.yaml
```

This profile pins Stage0 (Slow/Fast AR) to GPU 0 and Stage1 (DAC decoder)
to GPU 1 to remove AR/DAC contention, sets `max_num_seqs=64` on both
stages so concurrencies above 8 don't queue, and reduces
`connector_get_sleep_s` from 10 ms to 1 ms so DAC chunks aren't held in
the connector once they're ready.

For benchmark numbers see the discussion in
vllm-project/vllm-omni#2515 (initial H100x2 sweep by @Sy0307) and
vllm-project/vllm-omni#3323 (H20x2 sweep with the shipped config).

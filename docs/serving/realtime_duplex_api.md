# Realtime Duplex API

vLLM-Omni serves full-duplex speech models over a WebSocket endpoint,
`/v1/realtime`, that speaks the OpenAI Realtime vocabulary plus a
set of duplex extensions: the model decides when to listen and when to speak,
the user can talk over the assistant, playback progress is reported back so
history stays honest, and a dropped connection can resume the same session.
This page covers how to run a duplex deployment, how to drive it from Python
with `vllm_omni.clients.duplex.DuplexClient`, and the complete wire contract.

The handler is enabled by either a model-native `session_mode: duplex`
deployment or an explicit `duplex_session` configuration for turn-based
Server VAD. The runtime architecture is described in
[Full-Duplex Runtime (MiniCPM-o 4.5)](../design/fullduplex.md).

## Quick Start

### Start the Server

```bash
vllm-omni serve openbmb/MiniCPM-o-4_5 \
    --omni \
    --deploy-config vllm_omni/deploy/minicpmo_4_5.yaml \
    --trust-remote-code \
    --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8099
```

`vllm_omni/deploy/minicpmo_4_5.yaml` declares `session_mode: duplex` and
`duplex_session.max_sessions: 4`, which mounts the WebSocket routes
`ws://<host>:8099/v1/realtime` (this page) and `ws://<host>:8099/v1/duplex`
(the native dialect for raw-protocol clients) next to the usual HTTP API.
PersonaPlex and Nemotron VoiceChat use `vllm_omni/deploy/personaplex.yaml` and
`vllm_omni/deploy/nemotron_labs_voicechat_duplex.yaml` in the same way.

### Run the Example Client

`examples/online_serving/barge_in_client.py` asks a question, interrupts the
answer mid-stream, and writes one WAV per response:

```bash
python examples/online_serving/barge_in_client.py \
    --url ws://127.0.0.1:8099/v1/realtime \
    --model openbmb/MiniCPM-o-4_5 \
    --ref-audio /path/to/reference_voice.wav \
    --question-wav question_16k.wav \
    --interrupt-wav follow_up_16k.wav \
    --output-dir ./duplex_out
```

Input WAVs must be mono 16 kHz PCM16. `--ref-audio` is required by the
MiniCPM-o preset (the session is otherwise rejected with
`ref_audio_required`). `--preset personaplex` switches the session shape to
the PersonaPlex preset. The flow is diagrammed in
`examples/online_serving/barge_in_client_flow.md`.

## Using DuplexClient

`vllm_omni.clients.duplex` is a client-side package: it depends only on the
standard library, `pybase64`, and the `websockets` package, and it is never
imported by server code. Full signatures are on the
[API reference page](../api/README.md#clients).

### Open a session

`DuplexClient` is an async context manager. Entering it connects, sends
`session.update`, and waits for `session.created`; exiting sends
`session.close` and waits for `session.closed`.

```python
from vllm_omni.clients.duplex import DuplexClient, audio_data_url
from vllm_omni.clients.minicpmo_4_5 import create_duplex_session_config

config = create_duplex_session_config(ref_audio=audio_data_url(Path("reference_voice.wav")))
async with DuplexClient("ws://127.0.0.1:8099/v1/realtime", model="openbmb/MiniCPM-o-4_5", config=config) as client:
    print(client.session_id, client.session_info["capabilities"])
```

The session shape comes from `SessionConfig`; model-specific knobs ride in
its `extra_body`, so the client itself stays model-neutral and each model
ships a preset:

| Preset | Input / output audio | What it sets |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `vllm_omni.clients.minicpmo_4_5.create_duplex_session_config(ref_audio=...)` | 16 kHz `pcm16` / 24 kHz `pcm16` | `extra_body.native_duplex=True` (opt in to the model-native lane), `force_listen_count=0`, `overlap_policy="listen_only"`, `playback_commit_policy="ack_only"`; `ref_audio` is the assistant voice clip |
| `vllm_omni.clients.personaplex.create_duplex_session_config(voice="NATF2.pt", persona="")` | 24 kHz `pcm_f32le` / 24 kHz `pcm16` | bundled `.pt` voice prompt and the persona as `instructions` |
| `SessionConfig(...)` | 16 kHz `pcm16` / 24 kHz `pcm16` | model-neutral defaults; pass `extra_body`, `turn_detection`, `overlap_policy`, `playback_commit_policy`, `instructions`, `voice`, `temperature` yourself |

Keyword overrides on a preset replace the corresponding `SessionConfig`
field, e.g. `create_duplex_session_config(ref_audio=..., temperature=0.6)`.

Constructor options: `session_id` (names the session the client creates; it
does not resume or take over an existing session — entering the client always
performs the `session.update` handshake), `reconnect` (a `ReconnectPolicy`,
default five attempts with 0.25–4 s jittered backoff; `None` disables
auto-resume), `heartbeat_interval_s` (default 30 s; `None` disables the lease
heartbeat), `handshake_timeout_s`, and `connect` (a custom transport factory,
used by tests and benchmarks). Resume is supported only as automatic reconnect
within the same `DuplexClient` instance (see
[Reconnect and resume](#reconnect-and-resume)); re-attaching from a new client
or process requires the wire-level `session.resume` handshake
(`resume_token`, `incarnation`, `last_received_server_event_seq`), which this
client does not expose.

### Stream audio and commit a turn

```python
from vllm_omni.clients.duplex import read_pcm16_wav

question = read_pcm16_wav(Path("question_16k.wav"))
await client.stream_pcm(question, chunk_ms=100)      # paced 100 ms appends
await client.commit(create_response=False)           # the model decides listen/speak
```

`stream_pcm` slices PCM into `chunk_ms` appends and paces them in real time
(`realtime=False` sends as fast as possible). `append_audio` sends one chunk
and accepts `is_speech` and `video_frames` (base64 JPEG/PNG strings riding
the append that closes a one-second model unit — data URLs are accepted and
their prefix stripped; `stream_pcm(video_frames=...,
stacked_video_frames=...)` interleaves a frame track automatically and
returns the number of frames sent). A turn is ended with `commit`, never by
a flag on the append.

`commit` seals the buffered utterance into a user item. With the default
`auto_response=True` a commit lets the model respond; pass
`create_response=False` to leave the listen/speak decision entirely to a
model-native session, or set `auto_response=False` in the config and call
`client.send({"type": "response.create"})` when you want an answer. In the
model-native lane the audio is already streaming into the model before the
commit, so the model may start answering — or emit a listen decision —
without any commit at all.

### Consume responses

`responses()` demultiplexes the event stream into one `ResponseHandle` per
assistant response. A model listen decision surfaces as an already-finished
handle with `decision == "listen"`.

```python
async for response in client.responses():
    if response.decision == "listen":
        continue                                   # the model kept listening
    async for chunk in response.audio():           # decoded PCM16 at 24 kHz
        play(chunk)
        await client.ack_playback(response.played_ms, response_id=response.response_id)
    await response.wait()
    print(response.transcript, response.done_event.raw["response"]["status"])
    break
```

`ResponseHandle` exposes `response_id`, `decision` (`"speak"` / `"listen"`),
the accumulated `transcript` and `text`, `played_ms`, `created_event`,
`done_event`, `finished`, `audio()` and `wait()`.

`ack_playback(played_ms, response_id=..., committed_ms=...)` reports the
cumulative playback position. Call it while audio plays: with the MiniCPM-o
preset's `playback_commit_policy="ack_only"` the assistant turn enters the
conversation history only as far as you acknowledge it, which is what keeps
history truthful after an interruption. `acknowledge_collected_playback(client,
collector)` acknowledges everything an `EventCollector` has received, which is
what the example and the benchmarks do at the end of a turn.

### Interrupt

```python
await client.cancel_response()        # cancel the active response (epoch advances)
await client.clear_input()            # drop un-committed input audio
```

In the model-native lane you usually do not need either: keep streaming
microphone audio while the assistant speaks and the server's overlap policy
decides — a short remark is acknowledged, meaningful overlap is deferred to
the turn end, and on models that advertise `supports_barge_in` (MiniCPM-o
4.5) the in-flight response is cancelled. Each decision is reported as an
`overlap.decision` event. `cancel_response` and `clear_input` compose a
client-forced barge-in for clients that run their own VAD.

### Work with raw events

`events()` (or `async for event in client`) yields every server event from
now on as a typed `DuplexEvent` (`SessionCreated`, `ResponseCreated`,
`AudioDelta`, `TranscriptDelta`, `TextDelta`, `ListenDecision`,
`SpeakDecision`, `ResponseDone`, `SessionClosed`, `SessionExpired`,
`ErrorEvent`, and `ConnectionResumed` after an automatic resume; unknown
types arrive as plain `DuplexEvent`). Common accessors are `type`,
`event_id`, `session_id`, `response_id`, `item_id`, `server_event_seq`,
`audio` (decoded bytes), `text`, and `raw` (the wire dict).
`wait_for("response.done", timeout_s=30)` blocks for the next event of the
given type(s), and `send({...})` is the escape hatch for any client event
the wrapper does not have a method for (`response.create`,
`conversation.item.create`, `conversation.item.truncate`, ...); it returns
the stamped `event_id`.

### Reconnect and resume

On a transport drop the client reconnects with the `ReconnectPolicy` backoff
and sends `session.resume` from the last acknowledged `server_event_seq`.
Replayed events are deduplicated, consumers see one `ConnectionResumed`
event, and `client.incarnation` / `client.resume_token` are refreshed. The
server keeps a detached session alive for `disconnect_grace_s` (30 s by
default); after that a resume fails with `session_resume_expired`. Resume is
gated by `capabilities.supports_session_resume` (MiniCPM-o 4.5 and Nemotron
VoiceChat: yes; PersonaPlex: no). With `reconnect=None` the same drop surfaces
as `DuplexSessionClosedError`.

### Errors

Server `error` events are delivered as `ErrorEvent` (with `code`, `message`,
`related_event_id`) and raised as `DuplexProtocolError` from the awaiting
call; transport failures raise `DuplexConnectionError`; a session that ends
while you are awaiting it raises `DuplexSessionClosedError`. All three derive
from `DuplexClientError`.

### Measure latency

`EventCollector` accumulates events for assertions and metrics:

```python
from vllm_omni.clients.duplex import EventCollector

collector = EventCollector()
consume_task = asyncio.create_task(collector.consume(client))
commit_sent_at = time.monotonic()
await client.commit(create_response=False)
...
summary = collector.timing_summary(after_s=commit_sent_at, input_committed_at_s=commit_sent_at)
```

`timing_summary` reports client-observed first-text / first-audio latency,
audio cadence, and, when the deployment attaches engine stage metrics to the
response events (the benchmark requests them with
`extra_body.return_stage_metrics=True`), the Stage 0 token metrics
(`ttft_ms`, `tpot_ms`, `itls_ms`). It reports raw measurements only —
derived metrics such as the audio RTF are computed by the caller from
`audio_generation_ms` / `audio_duration_ms` (the benchmarks use
`vllm_omni.metrics.definitions.compute_audio_rtf`), keeping metric
definitions out of the dependency-free client. `audio_bytes(response_id)`, `count(type)`,
`errors()`, and `first_received_at(type)` cover the common assertions; the
`openai-realtime-duplex` benchmark backend (`vllm-omni bench serve`) is built
on the same helpers.

## API Reference

This section is the complete wire contract of `/v1/realtime`: how
the dialect relates to the OpenAI Realtime protocol, which surfaces each
model's capability flags gate, a catalogue of every client-to-server and
server-to-client event, and a JSON example for each. `DuplexClient` speaks
exactly this contract; raw WebSocket clients (any OpenAI Realtime client, or
your own) can use it directly. The ordering and cardinality rules behind it
are specified in the normative contract section of
[Full-Duplex Runtime (MiniCPM-o 4.5)](../design/fullduplex.md); a
compatibility change must update this section together with that table and
its protocol tests.

### Endpoint and transport

The endpoint is `ws(s)://<host>/v1/realtime`. Bare connections select the
session handler when the deployment declares either `session_mode: duplex`
or `duplex_session`. `?duplex=1` remains a compatibility alias, while
`?duplex=0` selects the legacy Realtime handler. Optional query parameters
are `model`, `session_id`,
`autostart` (`0` means resume-only), `resume`, and `native_duplex`
(`minicpmo45_native_duplex` is accepted as a deprecated alias and folded
into the canonical name). Every message is one JSON object per WebSocket
text frame, discriminated by `type`. Inbound events are applied in arrival
order through one per-session mailbox; outbound events preserve that order
and carry a monotonically increasing `server_event_seq`, which is the replay
cursor for `session.resume`. Client events may carry an `event_id`, echoed in
`error.error.event_id` when the event is rejected.

Session identity is `(session_id, incarnation)`; `attachment_generation`
names the current socket; `epoch` is the interruption fence that advances on
every cancel, clear, or barge-in; `turn_id` counts committed model turns;
`response_id` (item id `item_<response_id>`) names one assistant utterance.

**Tier** in the tables below: **1** means identical to OpenAI Realtime in
name and semantics; **2** means an OpenAI event name carrying vLLM-Omni
extensions that a stock OpenAI client ignores; **3** means vLLM-Omni only,
with no OpenAI counterpart.

### Capability negotiation by model

The event vocabulary is uniform, but several surfaces are gated by the
`capabilities` object the server returns in `session.created`; a client must
branch on those flags rather than on the model name. The current model
plugins advertise:

| Capability | MiniCPM-o 4.5 | PersonaPlex | Nemotron VoiceChat | Gated surface |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `implementation_level` | `model_native_duplex` (when `extra_body.native_duplex=true`) | `model_native_duplex` | `model_native_duplex` | model-owned `response.listen` / `response.speak`; the chat-fallback lane otherwise |
| `chunk_period_ms` | 1000 | 80 | 80 | the model unit that `response.listen` decisions and camera frames align to |
| `supports_session_resume` | yes | no | yes | `session.resume`, `session.resumed`, `session.replaced`, replay after a transport drop |
| `supports_barge_in` | yes | no | no | `barge_in`, `turn.signal{event:"barge_in"}`, `overlap_policy=barge_in_on_speech`, `turn_detection.server_vad` |
| `supports_audio_truncate` | yes | no | no | `conversation.item.truncate` and truncating `playback.ack` adjusting the stored assistant item |
| video input (`video_frames` on append) | consumed by Stage 0 | ignored | ignored | omni camera track |
| tool calls | no | no | yes | `response.function_call_arguments.*`, `function_call` items |

Everything else in the catalogue — session lifecycle, heartbeat and event
acknowledgement, append/commit/clear, the response envelope, playback
acknowledgement, and the error envelope — behaves identically for every
model.

### Compatibility with the OpenAI Realtime protocol

The Realtime dialect is, by design, an OpenAI-Realtime-compatible surface:
`RealtimeInputTranslator` / `RealtimeOutputProjector` exist to translate
the native duplex vocabulary onto OpenAI's schema so stock Realtime clients
work unmodified. The overlap falls into the three tiers used by the event catalogue below.

#### Tier 1: identical to OpenAI Realtime

| Direction | Messages |
| --- | --- |
| Client → server | `session.update`, `input_audio_buffer.append` / `.commit` / `.clear`, `conversation.item.create` / `.retrieve` / `.truncate` / `.delete`, `response.create`, `response.cancel`, `output_audio_buffer.clear` (OpenAI: WebRTC-only; here also a WebSocket event) |
| Server → client | `error` (same `{type, code, message, event_id, param}` envelope and the same classes `invalid_request_error` / `server_error` / `rate_limit_error`), `session.created`, `session.updated`, `input_audio_buffer.committed` / `.cleared` / `.speech_started` / `.speech_stopped`, `conversation.item.created` / `.added` / `.done` / `.deleted` / `.retrieved` / `.truncated`, `conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.completed`, `response.created`, `response.done`, `response.output_item.added` / `.done`, `response.content_part.added` / `.done`, `response.output_audio.delta` / `.done`, `response.output_audio_transcript.delta` / `.done`, `response.output_text.delta` / `.done`, `response.function_call_arguments.delta` / `.done`, `rate_limits.updated`, `output_audio_buffer.cleared` |
| Session fields | `model`, `modalities` / `output_modalities`, `instructions`, `voice`, `input_audio_format` / `output_audio_format` (beta spelling) **and** `audio.input.format` / `audio.output.format` objects (GA spelling), `turn_detection.server_vad {threshold, prefix_padding_ms, silence_duration_ms}`, `input_audio_transcription`, `input_audio_noise_reduction`, `tools`, `tool_choice`, `temperature`, `max_response_output_tokens`, `speed`, `tracing` |
| Object shapes | `realtime.session`, `realtime.item`, `realtime.response`; item content parts `input_text` / `input_audio` / `output_text` / `output_audio`; `function_call` and `function_call_output` items; `previous_item_id` chaining; `output_index` / `content_index` addressing |
| Sequencing | `response.created → output_item.added → content_part.added → deltas → *.done → content_part.done → output_item.done → response.done → rate_limits.updated`; `speech_started → speech_stopped → committed` |

Audio/transcript output uses only the current (non-beta) OpenAI event names
(`response.output_audio.delta`, not the deprecated `response.audio.delta`),
matching `openai.types.realtime` in the official `openai` Python SDK and what
clients built against it (e.g. `livekit-plugins-openai`'s non-Azure code path)
expect; a client still on the old beta SDK types would not recognize these
events. Session fields and `conversation.item.*` events, in contrast, are
deliberately dual: the server emits and accepts **both** the beta and the GA
spellings at once (`output_modalities` alongside `modalities`,
`conversation.item.added` alongside `conversation.item.created`) so either
generation of OpenAI client parses the stream.

#### Tier 2: OpenAI names carrying vLLM-Omni extensions

A stock client ignores the extra keys; the extensions are additive.

| Message | Extension |
| --- | --- |
| `session.created` / `session.updated` | top-level `incarnation`, `attachment_generation`, `resume_token`; inside `session`: `state`, `turn_state`, `epoch`, `turn_id`, `active_request_id`, `active_response_id`, `active_response_turn_id`, `overlap_policy`, `overlap_*_ms/rms`, `playback_commit_policy`, `playback`, `capabilities`, `ref_audio`, `extra_body`, `idle_timeout_s`, `response_format` |
| `response.created` / `response.done` / `response.listen` | `response_id` at top level; the raw duplex event under `response.metadata` (`duplex_event`); `status_details.reason` uses vLLM reasons (`barge_in`, `client_cancelled`, `new_response`, …) |
| `response.output_audio.delta` | `format`, `sample_rate_hz`, `metadata{session_id, epoch, model_speak, end_of_turn, audio_duration_ms, audio_text_marks, playback}` |
| `response.speak` (inserted before the first delta) | not an OpenAI event, but rides the OpenAI response envelope (`response_id`, `item_id`, `output_index`, `content_index`) |
| `input_audio_buffer.append` | `is_speech`, `video_frames` (+ `max_slice_nums`), `duration_ms`, `audio_end_ms`, per-event `format` / `sample_rate_hz` |
| `input_audio_buffer.commit` | `final`, `response_create`, `is_speech:false` (silence declaration) |
| `input_audio_buffer.committed` | the native `input.committed` event wrapped under `event` (`turn_id`, `epoch`, `history_len`, `message`, `response_create_deferred`) |
| `conversation.item.*` server events | echo of the originating event under `event` |
| `error` | the error **codes** are vLLM-Omni's (OpenAI standardises only the class); handshake-stage errors use the flat native shape `{type:"error", error:"…", code}` |

Semantic divergences hidden behind shared names:

- **Commit ≠ response.** In the native lane audio streams into the model
  before any commit; a commit may end in `response.listen` and no
  response, and the model may open a response with no commit at all.
  OpenAI: commit ⇒ item, `response.create` ⇒ exactly one response.
- With `turn_detection={"type":"server_vad"}`, omitted `interrupt_response`
  defaults to `false` on turn-based models such as Qwen3-Omni, enabling
  endpointing and automatic responses without interruption. Explicit `true`
  is rejected there. Model-native duplex keeps the `true` default and rejects
  `false`; its VAD implies `overlap_policy=barge_in_on_speech`.
  This capability-dependent default differs from OpenAI's `true` default;
  the effective configuration is returned in `session.created` / `session.updated`.
  `semantic_vad` is unsupported.
- `rate_limits.updated` is always an empty list (compatibility only).
- Cancellation never reuses a `response_id`; truncation is driven by
  `playback.ack` as well as `conversation.item.truncate`.

#### Tier 3: vLLM-Omni only

| Area | Messages / fields |
| --- | --- |
| Session lifetime | `session.heartbeat` / `session.heartbeat_ack`, `session.event_ack`, `session.close` / `session.closed`, `session.resume` / `session.resumed` / `session.replaced` / `session.expired` / `session.resync_required`; `server_event_seq`, `resume_token`, `incarnation`, `attachment_generation`; query params `?duplex=1`, `autostart`, `resume`, `native_duplex` |
| Turn-taking | `response.speak`, `response.listen`, `overlap.decision`, `overlap_policy`, `barge_in`, `turn.signal`, `input.cancel`, `input.text.append`, `epoch` / `turn_id` fencing, `force_listen` |
| Playback truth | `playback.ack` / `playback.acknowledged`, `playback_commit_policy` (`ack_only` \| `commit_all_on_done`), `playback{generated_ms, sent_ms, played_ms, committed_ms}`, `history_committed`, `audio_text_marks` |
| Model negotiation | `capabilities{implementation_level, supports_input_append, supports_barge_in, supports_session_resume, chunk_period_ms, input_modes, …}`, `ref_audio`, `extra_body` (`auto_response`, `native_duplex` — deprecated alias `minicpmo45_native_duplex` is folded into it, `force_listen_count`, `duplex_initial_user_text`) |
| Diagnostics | `runtime.control`, `duplex.function_call.done`, the full error-code vocabulary (`REALTIME_ERROR_TYPES_BY_CODE` in `vllm_omni/entrypoints/duplex/realtime_state.py`) |

#### Consequences for clients

- Event **names** are roughly 70 % OpenAI's; payloads are OpenAI's plus
  additive extensions; everything that makes the endpoint full-duplex —
  model-owned turn-taking, playback truth, interruption fencing, resumable
  sessions — lives in Tier 3.
- An **unmodified OpenAI Realtime client** can hold a conversation
  (commit-driven or `turn_detection: server_vad`), but it will never see
  `response.listen` / `response.speak`, cannot resume after a transport
  drop, will not receive replay after reconnect, and its server-side
  history is only as honest as `commit_all_on_done` allows because it never
  sends `playback.ack`.
- A **duplex-aware client** (`vllm_omni.clients.duplex.DuplexClient`) uses
  the Tier 3 surface on top of the same Tier 1 events, so both kinds of
  client can share one deployment and one event log.

### Event catalogue

Every event type the Realtime route accepts or emits, with a worked example in the next section: 21
client→server and 42 server→client. Aliases (`push_chunk`,
`input.audio.append`, `input_text.append`, `push_text`, `signal_turn`,
`audio.playback_ack`, `close_session`, `close`, `session_close`) share the
payload of their canonical event and are not listed separately; the alias
table lives in the normative contract section of [Full-Duplex Runtime (MiniCPM-o 4.5)](../design/fullduplex.md).

#### Client to server

| Event type | Tier | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `session.update` | 2 | Open handshake on first send (creates the session); later sends reconfigure it. OpenAI name; `session` object carries vLLM-Omni keys (`ref_audio`, `overlap_policy`, `playback_commit_policy`, `extra_body`, ...). |
| `session.heartbeat` | 3 | Keepalive; refreshes the engine session lease. |
| `session.event_ack` | 3 | Acknowledges received server events by `server_event_seq`; trims the resume replay journal. |
| `session.close` | 3 | Graceful close; answered with `session.closed`. |
| `session.resume` | 3 | Re-attach a live session on a new socket (`resume_token`, `incarnation`, `last_received_server_event_seq`). |
| `input_audio_buffer.append` | 2 | Append one audio chunk. OpenAI name; extended with `is_speech`, `video_frames`, `duration_ms`, `audio_end_ms`, per-event `format`/`sample_rate_hz`. |
| `input_audio_buffer.commit` | 2 | Seal the buffered utterance into a user item. OpenAI name; extended with `final`, `response_create`, `is_speech:false`. |
| `input.commit` | 3 | Alias of `input_audio_buffer.commit` accepted by the runner. |
| `input_audio_buffer.clear` | 1 | Drop un-committed input audio. |
| `input.cancel` | 3 | Cancel pending input; advances `epoch`. |
| `input.text.append` | 3 | Append text to the open input item (chat-fallback lane only). |
| `conversation.item.create` | 1 | Add a completed user item (text, audio, or `function_call_output`) to history. |
| `conversation.item.retrieve` | 1 | Fetch a stored item by id. |
| `conversation.item.delete` | 1 | Delete a stored item by id. |
| `conversation.item.truncate` | 1 | Truncate an assistant item's audio/transcript at `audio_end_ms`. |
| `response.create` | 1 | Explicitly request a response with per-response overrides. |
| `response.cancel` | 1 | Cancel the active (or named) response; advances `epoch`. |
| `output_audio_buffer.clear` | 1 | Discard queued output audio; advances `epoch` (OpenAI: WebRTC-only, here also WebSocket). |
| `barge_in` | 3 | Explicit hard interrupt; requires `capabilities.supports_barge_in`. |
| `turn.signal` | 3 | External turn-taking signal (e.g. `event:"barge_in"`); same capability gate. |
| `playback.ack` | 3 | Report cumulative playback progress (`played_ms`, `committed_ms`, optional `truncate`). |

#### Server to client

| Event type | Tier | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `session.created` | 2 | Session opened. OpenAI name; adds `incarnation`, `attachment_generation`, `resume_token` and vLLM-Omni keys inside `session` (`epoch`, `turn_id`, `playback`, `capabilities`, ...). |
| `session.updated` | 2 | Echo of the effective session config after every `session.update` (same extended `session` object). |
| `session.heartbeat_ack` | 3 | Reply to `session.heartbeat`. |
| `session.closed` | 3 | Last event on the socket; `reason` ∈ `session_close`, `timeout`, `disconnect`, ... |
| `session.resumed` | 3 | Resume accepted; carries the new `attachment_generation` and rotated `resume_token`; journaled events are replayed after it. |
| `session.replaced` | 3 | Sent to the superseded socket when another socket resumes the session. |
| `session.expired` | 3 | Engine lease reaped (`disconnect_grace_expired`, `idle_ttl_expired`); socket closes after it. |

| `input_audio_buffer.speech_started` | 1 | Speech onset detected (server VAD, client hint, or RMS heuristic). |
| `input_audio_buffer.speech_stopped` | 1 | Speech end detected. |
| `input_audio_buffer.committed` | 2 | Commit accepted. OpenAI name; wraps the native `input.committed` payload under `event` (`turn_id`, `epoch`, `response_create_deferred`, ...). |
| `input_audio_buffer.cleared` | 1 | Input buffer cleared (after `input_audio_buffer.clear` or `input.cancel`). |
| `conversation.item.added` | 2 | Item entered history (GA spelling). OpenAI name; carries `previous_item_id` and echoes the originating event. |
| `conversation.item.created` | 2 | Same as `conversation.item.added` in the beta spelling; both are emitted. |

### Message examples

Field values are illustrative; base64 payloads are shortened to `"…"`.
`C→S` = client sends, `S→C` = server sends. Every `S→C` event on the wire
additionally carries `"server_event_seq": <int>` (omitted below for brevity).

{"type": "playback.ack", "response_id": "resp_01", "item_id": "item_resp_01", "played_ms": 1000, "committed_ms": 1000}
```

```json
{
  "type": "playback.acknowledged",
  "event": {
    "type": "playback.acknowledged",
    "session_id": "sess_demo_01",
    "epoch": 0,
    "item_id": "item_resp_01",
    "played_ms": 1000,
    "committed_ms": 1000,
    "truncate": false,
    "playback": {"generated_ms": 2400, "sent_ms": 2400, "played_ms": 1000, "committed_ms": 1000},
    "history_committed": false
  }
}
```

truncating ack after an interruption (what was actually heard)

```json
{"type": "playback.ack", "response_id": "resp_01", "played_ms": 1850, "committed_ms": 1850, "truncate": true}
```

#### Overlap and barge-in

`S→C overlap.decision`

```json
{
  "type": "overlap.decision",
  "session_id": "sess_demo_01",
  "epoch": 0,
  "policy": "listen_only",
  "action": "listen",
  "reason": "long_overlap_speech",
  "overlap_ms": 1400,
  "buffer_audio": true,
  "defer_runtime_append": true,
  "force_listen": true
}
```

```json
{"type": "overlap.decision", "session_id": "sess_demo_01", "epoch": 0, "policy": "barge_in_on_speech", "action": "barge_in", "reason": "server_vad_utterance_active"}
```

server-VAD session (`session.update` fragment) and the annotated append the
translator forwards internally (shown for reference; clients never see it)

```json
{"type": "session.update", "session": {"turn_detection": {"type": "server_vad", "threshold": 0.5, "prefix_padding_ms": 300, "silence_duration_ms": 500}, "overlap_policy": "barge_in_on_speech"}}
```

```json
{"type": "input_audio_buffer.append", "audio": "…", "format": "pcm16", "sample_rate_hz": 16000, "is_speech": true, "force_listen": true, "vad": {"backend": "silero", "is_speech": true, "speech_active": true, "speech_started": true, "speech_stopped": false, "speech_probability": 0.93}}
```

`S→C runtime.control` (only when an engine signal was partially unsupported)

```json
{"type": "runtime.control", "session_id": "sess_demo_01", "epoch": 1, "result": {"…": "redacted engine control result"}}
```

#### Errors

`S→C error` — Realtime shape

```json
{
  "type": "error",
  "error": {
    "type": "invalid_request_error",
    "code": "input_audio_buffer_empty",
    "message": "input_audio_buffer.commit requires a non-empty input audio buffer.",
    "event_id": "evt_0060"
  }
}
```

```json
{"type": "error", "error": {"type": "invalid_request_error", "code": "unsupported_turn_detection", "message": "turn_detection.interrupt_response=false is unsupported; use turn_detection=null for model-owned listen/speak", "event_id": "evt_0001", "param": "turn_detection"}}
```

```json
{"type": "error", "error": {"type": "server_error", "code": "runtime_append_failed", "message": "stale epoch: expected 1, got 0"}}
```

```json
{"type": "error", "error": {"type": "rate_limit_error", "code": "duplex_session_busy", "message": "duplex session capacity reached (max_sessions=4)"}}
```

Handshake-stage errors (before the Realtime projector is bound) use the
flat native shape:

```json
{"type": "error", "error": "Unknown or expired duplex session: sess_demo_01", "code": "session_resume_expired"}
```

#### Coverage

The examples above cover every event type the Realtime route emits or
accepts (verified by diffing the `type` literals in
`vllm_omni/entrypoints/duplex/` against this document). Not shown, because
they never reach a `/v1/realtime?duplex=1` client unprojected: the native
`/v1/duplex` dialect (`session.create` / `open_session` / `session.config`,
`input.committed`, `input.cancelled`, `audio.cancelled`,
`response.output_audio.delta`, `response.text.delta`, `response.message`,
`function_call.done`) — their Realtime projections are the examples above
(see the name map at the end of this section) — and the runner-internal markers `__timeout__`,
`__disconnect__`, `__replaced_attachment__`. Input aliases (`push_chunk`,
`input.audio.append`, `input_text.append`, `push_text`, `signal_turn`,
`audio.playback_ack`, `close_session`, `close`, `session_close`) share the
payload of their canonical event (see the alias table in [Full-Duplex Runtime (MiniCPM-o 4.5)](../design/fullduplex.md)).

#### Native to Realtime name map

The native `/v1/duplex` dialect is what the session runner produces; the
Realtime projector renames and fans out these events before they reach a
`/v1/realtime?duplex=1` client.

| Native / internal event | Realtime projection |
| --- | --- |
| `session.create` (`open_session`, `session.config`) | first `session.update` |
| `input.committed` | `conversation.item.added` / `conversation.item.created`, `input_audio_buffer.committed`, `conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.completed`, `conversation.item.done` |
| `input.cancelled` | `input_audio_buffer.cleared` |
| `response.output_audio.delta` (with `audio_transcript`) | optional `response.speak`, then `response.output_audio.delta` and `response.output_audio_transcript.delta` |
| `response.output_audio.done` / `response.output_text.done` | `response.output_audio.done` / `response.output_text.done` |
| `response.text.delta` | `response.output_text.delta` |
| `response.message` (chat-fallback raw chunk) | passed through |
| `audio.cancelled` | optional `output_audio_buffer.cleared`, then the cancelled terminal events and `response.done` with `status: "cancelled"` |
| `function_call.done` | `response.created`, `response.output_item.added` (`function_call` item), `response.function_call_arguments.delta` / `.done`, `response.output_item.done`, `response.done` |
| `playback.acknowledged` | `playback.acknowledged` (wrapped verbatim under `event`) |
| `runtime.control`, `session.resumed`, `session.replaced`, `session.expired`, `session.resync_required`, `session.heartbeat_ack` | passed through unchanged |

## Known Limitations

- Several surfaces are capability-gated per model (see *Capability
  negotiation by model* above): PersonaPlex does not support session resume,
  barge-in, or audio truncation; Nemotron VoiceChat does not support barge-in
  or audio truncation; camera frames are consumed only by MiniCPM-o 4.5; tool
  calls are produced only by Nemotron VoiceChat.
- `turn_detection` supports `server_vad` or `null`, not `semantic_vad`.
  Turn-based models support endpointing without interruption, including
  `create_response=false` for explicit response creation. Model-native duplex
  requires `interrupt_response=true` and `create_response=true`.
- `input_audio_transcription` and `input_audio_noise_reduction` are accepted
  and echoed but no separate transcription or noise-reduction stage runs;
  transcripts come from the model.
- `rate_limits.updated` is emitted for compatibility only and always carries
  an empty list.
- Session capacity is bounded by `duplex_session.max_sessions` in the deploy
  configuration; admission beyond it fails with `duplex_session_busy` or
  `resource_exhausted`.
- The native `/v1/duplex` route speaks the internal dialect and does not
  support `session.resume`; use `/v1/realtime?duplex=1` for the contract on
  this page.

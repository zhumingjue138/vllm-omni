# Multi-Level Automated Testing System Overview

## Document Overview

This testing system aims to build a complete, efficient, and well-structured quality assurance framework for the development, integration, and release of model services. It draws on the concept of the test pyramid from modern software engineering, progressively expanding testing activities from basic code logic verification to complex end-to-end (E2E) functionality, performance, accuracy, and even long-term stability validation.

Through five levels (L1-L5) and common (Common) specifications, the system clarifies the testing objectives, scope, execution frequency, and required resources for different development stages (e.g., each commit, PR merge, daily build, pre-release). This ensures that models meet high standards for functionality, performance, and reliability across various deployment scenarios (online serving and offline inference).

**Test Dir placement (summary):** component / unit under `tests/{component}/` mirroring `vllm_omni/`; model E2E under `tests/e2e/online_serving/`, `tests/e2e/offline_inference/`, and `tests/e2e/accuracy/`; feature integration under `tests/e2e/features/<feature>/`; doc example tests under `tests/examples/online_serving/` and `tests/examples/offline_inference/`; performance under `tests/dfx/perf/`; stability under `tests/dfx/stability/`; reliability under `tests/dfx/reliability/`. Do **not** add new top-level directories under `tests/` that are unrelated to a `vllm_omni` component (or to the established `e2e` / `dfx` / `helpers` / `examples` / `buildkite` layout).

For per-level test authoring (markers, examples), see [Test Writing Guide](./test_writing_guide.md).

## Common Specifications

Before entering specific testing levels, the project establishes two common specifications aimed at standardizing the development process and quickly locating issues.

1. ***PR Checklist ([`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-omni/blob/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md))***: This template defines the self-check items that must be completed before submitting a code review (Pull Request). It ensures that each code change meets basic requirements such as code style, dependency updates, and documentation synchronization before entering the automated testing pipeline, serving as the first manual line of defense for quality assurance.
2. ***CI Failure Explanation ([CI Failures](./failures.md))***: This document archives and explains common failure patterns in the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline, error log interpretation, and preliminary troubleshooting steps. It helps developers and testers quickly diagnose the causes of automated test failures, improving problem-solving efficiency.

## Notes

### L4 cadence (nightly and pre-release)

CUDA **L4** (`full_model`) jobs are defined once in [`.buildkite/cuda/test-nightly.yml`](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-omni/blob/main/.buildkite/cuda/test-nightly.yml). That file is reused at two cadences:

- **Nightly:** scheduled `main` builds with `NIGHTLY=1` (and PR labels such as `nightly-test` / `omni-test`). Default fleet is typically H100.
- **Pre-release:** the same L4 suite runs again on extra GPU SKUs before a release (for example B200 via `MIRROR_HW=b200`), so `full_model` coverage is not limited to the nightly machine type.

How count-form `mirror_hardwares` and `MIRROR_HW` pick a SKU: [CI Settings](./ci_settings.md).

### L2 / L3 diff-aware CI (CUDA)

On CUDA **L2** and **L3**, **E2E Test** Buildkite jobs may be omitted at pipeline upload when the PR diff does not touch their path prefixes; other groups still always upload. Full two-layer mechanics and YAML examples: [CI Settings — Diff-aware CI](./ci_settings.md#diff-aware-ci) ([step filtering](./ci_settings.md#step-filtering)).

### Test helper environment variables

Some shared helpers under `tests/helpers/` honor optional environment variables for local debugging. These are **not** set in CI by default.

| Variable | Accepted values | Description |
| -------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| `VLLM_OMNI_KEEP_REQUEST_MEDIA` | `1`, `true`, `yes` (case-insensitive) | When enabled, temporary WAV files created by `tests.helpers.media.convert_audio_bytes_to_text` are **not** deleted when the pytest process exits. By default, each call writes a unique file under the system temp directory via `tempfile.mkstemp` and registers `atexit` cleanup. Use this when debugging audio output validation (Whisper transcription, keyword checks, text–audio similarity). The saved path is logged as `audio data is saved: <path>`. |

Example (Linux / macOS):

```bash
export VLLM_OMNI_KEEP_REQUEST_MEDIA=1
pytest -s -v tests/e2e/online_serving/test_qwen3_omni.py -k test_mix_to_text_audio
```

Example (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
$env:VLLM_OMNI_KEEP_REQUEST_MEDIA = "1"
pytest -s -v tests/e2e/online_serving/test_qwen3_omni.py -k test_mix_to_text_audio
```

## Summary

This multi-level testing system achieves continuous, progressive validation of model service quality by tightly integrating testing activities with the development workflow (commit, review, merge, release). From rapid unit testing to comprehensive end-to-end testing, and further to in-depth performance, stability, and reliability verification, each level has clear objectives, collectively building a robust quality protection net. By following this system, teams can deliver high-quality, highly reliable model services more efficiently.

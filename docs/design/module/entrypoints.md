# Entrypoints and serving boundaries

Entrypoints translate offline, CLI, and serving requests into stable engine
operations and translate engine outputs into public responses.

## Contract status

This document describes current entrypoint responsibilities plus the boundary
under review in the open roadmap
[#5227](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-omni/issues/5227) and helper-move
PR [#5453](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-omni/pull/5453). In-flight
helper locations are not treated as current paths.

## Ownership boundary

This document owns offline API semantics, CLI and serve composition,
supported OpenAI-compatible routes, request validation and normalization,
response conversion, streaming/session behavior, and engine handoff.

It does not own configuration precedence, cross-stage routing, stage
placement, payload implementation, or semantic error classification.
`entrypoints/openai/errors.py` is an explicit primary-path exception owned by
`error_contracts.md`.

## Candidate invariants

These identifiers are proposals while the document is `draft`.

### ENTRY-INV-001: Entrypoints adapt but do not orchestrate

**Rule:** Entrypoints MUST NOT implement cross-stage routing or stage lifecycle
policy.

### ENTRY-INV-100: Public requests are normalized once

**Rule:** Public protocol values MUST be validated and converted to internal
request contracts before engine submission.

### ENTRY-INV-101: Streaming preserves request identity

**Rule:** Every streamed response MUST remain associated with the request and
output modality that produced it.

The reviewer-proposed rule that model-specific behavior should stay behind a
common adapter or processor abstraction remains an unnumbered candidate until
the entrypoint refactor makes that boundary enforceable.

## Invariant namespace

`ENTRY-INV` reserves `001-099` for boundary and dependency direction,
`100-199` for normalization, sessions, and streaming, `200-299` for
disconnect, cancellation, rendering, and cleanup, and `300-399` for upstream
route and renderer compatibility. Numbers become append-only after normative
promotion.

## Safe-change guide

Test request validation, protocol conversion, model-adapter routing,
streaming, session identity, disconnect/cancellation, and error mapping for
each affected offline or serving entrypoint. Sleep must wait for in-flight
`generate()` admission before EngineCore offload; `wake_up` does not resume
admission — callers must `resume_generation()`. Sleeping tags are tracked per
stage so `wake_up(stage_ids=[0])` does not skip a later `wake_up(stage_ids=[1])`.
Streaming input pumps take an admission slot immediately before each EngineCore
ADD or update, not while waiting for the next client chunk. Frontend abort
keeps `request_states` until `generate()` consumes the terminal output.

## Promotion gate

- Reconcile the page after #5227's P0 ownership work and #5453's final
  disposition.
- Publish a supported route/transport matrix rather than claiming blanket
  OpenAI parity.
- Verify one normalization and handoff path per route family and one terminal
  outcome per streaming transport.
- Promote the `api_server.py` composition-root rule only after helper moves and
  import boundaries enforce it.
- Obtain approval from a technical owner and an independent validation
  reviewer.

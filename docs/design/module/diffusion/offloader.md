# Diffusion offloader

The offloader owns component residency, transfer scheduling, memory accounting,
prefetch, and teardown for diffusion execution.

## Candidate invariants

### OFFLOAD-INV-001: Residency is explicit

**Rule:** Each managed component MUST have one known residency state and one
owner responsible for transitions.

### OFFLOAD-INV-002: Use follows readiness

**Rule:** Runtime execution MUST NOT consume a component until its transfer to
the required device is complete.

### OFFLOAD-INV-003: Transfers preserve model state

**Rule:** Offloading MUST preserve parameter and buffer identity, dtype, device,
and correctness required by the selected execution mode.

### OFFLOAD-INV-004: Memory is bounded and released

**Rule:** Retained host and device copies MUST respect configured limits and
provide deterministic teardown.

Allocator-cache retention MUST remain local to an explicit component owner,
declare both cache and physical-free-memory bounds, release conservatively
when telemetry is unavailable, and force release on failure or memory
pressure. It MUST NOT replace unconditional executor shutdown cleanup.

## Safe-change guide

Test enabled and disabled paths, repeated execution, asynchronous transfer,
memory limits, failure, teardown, and numerical equivalence.

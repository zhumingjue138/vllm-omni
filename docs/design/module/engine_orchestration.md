# Engine orchestration

Engine orchestration coordinates configured AR and diffusion stages while
keeping public clients independent from stage processes and transports.

## Contract status

This document is a draft description of current behavior. It also identifies
the boundary affected by the in-flight stage client/process refactor in
[#5441](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-omni/pull/5441). Names and
responsibilities proposed only by that PR are not current contracts.

The orchestration loop also has an opt-in event-driven mode
(`VLLM_OMNI_EVENT_DRIVEN_ORCH=1`, default off) proposed in
[#5221](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-omni/pull/5221). It changes poll
cadence only: the routing, ordering, and terminal-state contracts below hold
identically on both loops.

## Ownership boundary

This document owns `AsyncOmniEngine`, `Orchestrator`, request-state creation,
cross-stage routing, output ordering, companion tracking, control/RPC
correlation, cancellation propagation, and terminal-state convergence.

It does not own stage placement, replica selection, stage-process startup,
payload schemas, public protocol rendering, connector transport, or semantic
error classification. Those responsibilities belong to the stage runtime,
I/O, entrypoint, connector, and error contracts.

## Candidate invariants

These identifiers are proposals while the document is `draft`.

### ORCH-INV-001: The orchestrator owns cross-stage routing

**Rule:** Entrypoints and stage clients MUST NOT independently forward a
request to a downstream logical stage.

### ORCH-INV-002: Stage clients do not own routing policy

**Rule:** Stage clients MUST implement communication and lifecycle operations
without selecting the next logical stage.

### ORCH-INV-100: Terminal state is monotonic

**Rule:** Once a request reaches a terminal state, orchestration MUST NOT
forward new work for that request.

## Invariant namespace

`ORCH-INV` reserves `001-099` for dependency direction, `100-199` for
request state and ordering, `200-299` for failure/cancellation/cleanup, and
`300-399` for extension points, shutdown ordering, and upstream alignment.
Numbers become append-only after normative promotion.

## Safe-change guide

Test routing, output ordering, queue correlation, cancellation, failure
propagation, shutdown ordering, and representative multi-stage execution.
AR abort of a final-stage LLM request must deliver a terminal output with
`finish_reason="abort"` and the generated prefix so collocated training can
resume; diffusion abort remains whole-sample retry. Aborting a parallel-sampling
child must drop `parent_requests` once no children remain. EngineCore control
RPCs (`sleep` / `wake_up` / `pause_scheduler` / `resume_scheduler`) must
propagate worker exceptions rather than returning `{"supported": False}`.
When a request has multiple final output stages, only the last abort message
is request-terminal. Output-processor abort state is committed only after the
physical EngineCore abort succeeds.
Changes that cross into stage runtime or public error behavior require review
from that contract's owners.

## Promotion gate

- Reconcile current names and boundaries after #5441 merges, closes, or is
  replaced.
- Demonstrate one terminal outcome per request across success, abort,
  request-scoped failure, and fatal engine failure.
- Verify queue correlation and orchestrator-before-runtime shutdown ordering
  in the cited validation paths.
- Obtain approval from a technical owner and an independent validation
  reviewer.

# ModelOpt Quantization

## Overview

ModelOpt quantization loads checkpoints produced by NVIDIA ModelOpt. The
quantized weights and scale tensors are generated before serving, so inference
does not run online calibration or convert a BF16 checkpoint at startup.

vLLM-Omni validates ModelOpt FP8, ModelOpt NVFP4, and ModelOpt mixed
FP8/NVFP4 checkpoint loading for diffusion transformer stages. The loader
auto-detects supported ModelOpt checkpoint configs and keeps non-transformer
components, such as the tokenizer, scheduler, text encoder, vision/audio
encoder, and VAE, on the base checkpoint unless a model-specific guide says
otherwise.

!!! note
    ModelOpt checkpoints are pre-quantized checkpoints. Do not pass
    `--quantization fp8` for these checkpoints. The checkpoint
    `quantization_config` selects the ModelOpt path.

!!! note
    `--force-cutlass-fp8`, `--linear-backend cutlass`, and
    `--moe-backend cutlass` are runtime backend selections for checkpoints that
    already carry supported ModelOpt quantized weights and scales. They do not
    quantize BF16 checkpoints at startup.

## Supported ModelOpt Checkpoint Formats

vLLM-Omni treats ModelOpt checkpoints as pre-quantized checkpoints. The
checkpoint config must identify ModelOpt as the quantization method or producer,
and the quantization algorithm must be one of the validated algorithms below.

| Checkpoint field | Supported value |
|------------------|-----------------|
| `method` / `quant_method` | `modelopt`, `modelopt_fp4`, `modelopt_mixed` |
| `producer.name` | `modelopt` |
| `quant_algo` | `FP8`, `FP8_PER_CHANNEL_PER_TOKEN`, `NVFP4`, `MIXED_PRECISION` |

| `quant_algo` | Runtime method | Typical use |
|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| `FP8`, `FP8_PER_CHANNEL_PER_TOKEN` | `modelopt` | FP8 diffusion transformer checkpoints |
| `NVFP4` | `modelopt_fp4` | NVFP4 diffusion transformer checkpoints |
| `MIXED_PRECISION` | `modelopt_mixed` | Mixed FP8/NVFP4 checkpoints with a ModelOpt per-layer policy |

For multi-component diffusion or omni models, only the checkpoint component
that contains ModelOpt quantized weights should use the ModelOpt quantization
method. Encoders, decoders, tokenizers, schedulers, and other BF16 components
stay unquantized unless the model-specific recipe validates otherwise.

## Hardware Support

| Device | Support |
|--------|---------|
| NVIDIA Blackwell GPU (SM 100+) | ✅ |
| NVIDIA Ada/Hopper GPU (SM 89+) | ✅ |
| NVIDIA Ampere GPU (SM 80+) | ⭕ |
| AMD ROCm | ⭕ |
| Intel XPU | ⭕ |
| Ascend NPU | ❌ |

Legend: `✅` supported, `❌` unsupported, `⭕` not verified in this guide.
The optional CUTLASS FP8 runtime override requires CUDA SM89+. ModelOpt NVFP4
and mixed FP8/NVFP4 diffusion checkpoints are currently validated on Blackwell
CUDA systems in the recipes below; other CUDA generations require separate
backend and quality validation.

### Multi-Stage Omni/TTS Model

| Model | Scope | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Qwen3-Omni | Thinker language-model stage | ModelOpt FP8 checkpoint path |
| Qwen3-Omni | Thinker language-model stage (W4A4 NVFP4) | Validated; see [Qwen3-Omni NVFP4 W4A4](#qwen3-omni-nvfp4-w4a4-thinker) below |
| Qwen3-TTS | TTS language-model stage | Not validated |

Audio encoder, vision encoder, talker, and code2wav stages stay in BF16 unless
a model-specific guide documents otherwise.

#### Qwen3-Omni NVFP4 W4A4 (thinker)

vLLM-Omni serves ModelOpt NVFP4 W4A4 quantizations of the
Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct thinker language model. The thinker text body
(attention + MoE experts) is quantized to NVFP4 with FP8 per-tensor input
scales; the audio encoder, vision encoder, talker, and code2wav stay in BF16.

| Variant | HF checkpoint | Hardware |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| W4A4 NVFP4 (full thinker) | `YihongJin/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct-NVFP4-W4A4-full-thinker-awqclip` | sm_100+ (Blackwell, FlashInfer FP4 GEMM) |

Calibration uses ModelOpt `mtq.NVFP4_DEFAULT_CFG` with the `awq_clip` algorithm
on 1024 ultrachat samples chat-templated through the Qwen3-Omni tokenizer.
Excluded modules: `*audio_tower*`, `*visual*`, `*talker*`, `*code2wav*`,
`*lm_head*`, `*mlp.gate*`. See `scripts/nvfp4/calibrate.py` for the reference
recipe.

!!! note "ModelOpt 0.44 NaN regression workaround"
    ModelOpt 0.44's float32 -> FP8 E4M3 cast of per-block weight scales
    occasionally emits literal NaN bytes (E4M3 encoding 0x7F / 0xFF) for
    blocks whose pre-cast scale rounds above the FP8 max of 448 after the
    global-scale division. A single NaN byte in any `weight_scale`
    propagates through the FP4 GEMM and collapses the served model output
    to `!!!!`. vLLM-Omni's `vllm_omni.patch` installs a defensive override
    of `ModelOptNvFp4LinearMethod.process_weights_after_loading` that
    clamps these bytes to the FP8 E4M3 max at load time. The override
    self-extinguishes once vllm-omni's vllm pin moves to a release
    containing the upstream fix. Set `VLLM_OMNI_SKIP_NVFP4_NAN_CLAMP=1`
    to disable the override for diagnostics.

Serving:

```bash
vllm serve YihongJin/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct-NVFP4-W4A4-full-thinker-awqclip \
    --omni --port 8000
```

> Do **not** pass `--enforce-eager` for production / benchmarks. CUDA graphs
> amortize launch overhead and unlock the FP4 throughput wins; with
> `--enforce-eager` set, W4A4 TPOT degrades ~10x relative to the CUDA-graph
> configuration.

### Multi-Stage Diffusion Model

ModelOpt checkpoints must be routed to the stage whose checkpoint contains the
ModelOpt `quantization_config`. BAGEL and GLM-Image are not listed as validated
ModelOpt targets yet.

## Configuration

For pre-quantized ModelOpt checkpoints, no `--quantization fp8` flag is needed.
The checkpoint config selects the ModelOpt path.

Online serving:

```bash
vllm serve <modelopt-checkpoint> \
  --omni \
  --tensor-parallel-size <N> \
  --linear-backend cutlass \
  --force-cutlass-fp8
```

For mixed FP8/NVFP4 MoE checkpoints, also select the validated MoE backend:

```bash
vllm serve <modelopt-mixed-moe-checkpoint> \
  --omni \
  --tensor-parallel-size <N> \
  --enable-expert-parallel \
  --linear-backend cutlass \
  --moe-backend cutlass \
  --force-cutlass-fp8
```

Offline inference:

```bash
python examples/offline_inference/text_to_image/text_to_image.py \
  --model <modelopt-checkpoint> \
  --tensor-parallel-size <N> \
  --prompt "a red ceramic teapot on a wooden table" \
  --height 1024 \
  --width 1024 \
  --num-inference-steps 20 \
  --seed 42 \
  --output outputs/modelopt.png
```

Python API:

```python
from vllm_omni import Omni

omni = Omni(
    model="<modelopt-checkpoint>",
    tensor_parallel_size=2,
    force_cutlass_fp8=True,
)
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `force_cutlass_fp8` / `--force-cutlass-fp8` | bool | `False` | Force CUTLASS FP8 linear kernels for supported ModelOpt FP8 diffusion stages on CUDA SM89+ |
| `--linear-backend cutlass` | str | auto | Select the validated CUTLASS linear backend for supported ModelOpt NVFP4 or mixed FP8/NVFP4 diffusion stages |
| `--moe-backend cutlass` | str | auto | Select the validated CUTLASS MoE backend for supported ModelOpt mixed MoE checkpoints |

## Cosmos3 Mixed-Precision Schedule

The experimental Cosmos3 schedule can use the checkpoint-native quantized GEMM for middle denoising
steps and dense 16-bit activation execution for selected first and last steps.
The schedule supports serialized ModelOpt FP8 and NVFP4 checkpoints:

| Detected weight format | Native middle steps | A16 boundary steps |
|------------------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| FP8 | W8A8 | W8A16 |
| NVFP4 | W4A4 | W4A16 |

The native and A16 paths share one quantized weight representation. The A16
path dequantizes the live backend weight and calls `F.linear`; it does not keep
a second checkpoint-weight snapshot. Scheduled FP8 currently requires
serialized tensorwise scales and a backend that retains canonical FP8 weights.
Scheduled NVFP4 requires a supported CUTLASS-compatible native or FlashInfer
layout. SmoothQuant, Marlin-repacked FP8, and per-channel/per-token FP8
schedules fail closed.

The reasoner uses dense A16 execution by default when its weights are FP8 or
NVFP4. Set the nested `reasoner` field to `native` to retain the checkpoint-native
W8A8/W4A4 path. A BF16 reasoner remains BF16 in either mode. The schedule
currently requires tensor parallel size 1 and one active request per worker,
does not support HSDP, and does not support block-scaled FP8. Its live-weight
design is compatible with model-level and standard layer-wise offload, but
those paths still require GPU end-to-end validation. Distributed layer-wise
offload is rejected because its direct loader bypasses ModelOpt post-load
transformations.

A checkpoint can opt in by adding a versioned policy to its authoritative
`transformer/config.json`. The same policy schema is used for FP8 and NVFP4:

```json
{
  "quantization_config": {
    "quant_method": "modelopt",
    "quant_algo": "FP8",
    "runtime": {
      "diffusion_step_policy": {
        "schema_version": 1,
        "type": "first_last_n",
        "index_space": "denoising_loop_iteration",
        "scope": ["transformer"],
        "default_mode": "native",
        "first_steps": {"count": 3, "mode": "a16"},
        "last_steps": {"count": 3, "mode": "a16"},
        "overlap": "a16",
        "reasoner": "a16"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The example preserves the checkpoint's existing `quant_method` and
`quant_algo`; only `runtime` is added.

When present and valid, the checkpoint policy is the default. An explicit
runtime object overrides it. To retain ordinary checkpoint-native execution
for every step, disable only the schedule:

```bash
vllm serve /path/to/Cosmos3-Nano-modelopt \
  --omni \
  --additional-config '{"cosmos3_mixed_precision":{"enabled":false}}'
```

This does not disable checkpoint quantization; it prevents installation of the
mixed-step runtime.

```bash
vllm serve /path/to/Cosmos3-Nano-modelopt \
  --omni \
  --additional-config \
  '{"cosmos3_mixed_precision":{"first_steps":3,"last_steps":3,"reasoner":"a16"}}'
```

The presence of `cosmos3_mixed_precision` supplies an explicit runtime
override; an empty object uses the defaults shown above.
The schedule uses vLLM's selected native backend and fails during loading if
its live weight layout cannot support A16 dequantization.
The runtime selects FP8 or NVFP4 from the checkpoint's ModelOpt configuration.
BF16 linears are untouched. Mixed FP8/NVFP4 checkpoints are not supported by
this schedule.

## Validation and Notes

1. Compare the ModelOpt checkpoint against the BF16 baseline with the same
   prompt, resolution, seed, and inference steps.
2. Use `tests/diffusion/quantization/test_quantization_quality.py` with
   `VLLM_OMNI_QUALITY_CONFIGS` to validate local baseline and quantized model
   paths.
3. For HunyuanImage-3.0 quantized DiT checkpoints, the opt-in accuracy check is:

   ```bash
   CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2,3 \
   HUNYUAN_IMAGE3_RUN_QUANT_ACCURACY=1 \
   HUNYUAN_IMAGE3_QUANT_DEVICES=0,1 \
   HUNYUAN_IMAGE3_QUANT_TP=2 \
   HUNYUAN_IMAGE3_BF16_MODEL=/path/to/hunyuan-image3-bf16 \
   HUNYUAN_IMAGE3_FP8_MODEL=/path/to/hunyuan-image3-modelopt-fp8 \
   HUNYUAN_IMAGE3_NVFP4_MODEL=/path/to/hunyuan-image3-modelopt-mixed-experts-nvfp4-dense-fp8 \
   PYTHONPATH=/path/to/vllm-omni:${PYTHONPATH:-} \
   python -m pytest -s -v \
     tests/e2e/accuracy/test_hunyuan_image3.py \
     -k quantized_dit_matches_bf16_accuracy
   ```

4. Report CLIP score deltas, SSIM, PSNR, throughput, latency, and peak memory
   when adding a new validated ModelOpt diffusion checkpoint.
5. Keep `--quantization fp8` for online FP8 from BF16 checkpoints; use this
   ModelOpt path only when the checkpoint already contains ModelOpt quantized
   weights and scales.

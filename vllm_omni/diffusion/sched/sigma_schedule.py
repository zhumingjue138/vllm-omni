    A DMD2 student only ever sees the few noise levels it was trained on, so a
    distilled release ships the exact positions instead of letting the server
    derive a uniform schedule from ``num_inference_steps``.

    This is deliberately distinct from
    ``vllm_omni.diffusion.models.dmd2.DMD2Config.denoising_timesteps``, which
    carries integer scheduler timesteps for scheduler-backed pipelines. Here the
    entries are continuous positions in ``[0, 1]`` that still need a per-modality
    time shift applied, which is what lets one schedule drive several coupled
    modalities at different shift scales.

"""Stage-0 talker for MiniMax Music 3.

A Qwen3 backbone predicts one audio frame per decode step. Each frame is
eight RVQ codebooks deep: the backbone's own ``lm_head`` emits ``c0`` and the
four-layer depth decoder walks ``c1..c7``. The conditioning signal handed to
the acoustic stage is the backbone hidden state concatenated with the seven
depth hidden states, so 8 x 4096 = 32768 dimensions per frame.

Two things make this model unusual inside vLLM:

* **Every request decodes as two rows.** Classifier-free guidance is not
  optional here. The conditioned row sees the real prompt and the
  unconditioned row sees the same prompt with the caption-and-lyrics span
  replaced by ``<|audio_cfg|>``. Codes are drawn from the guided blend and
  then fed back to *both* rows, so the pair stays token-identical. Rows are
  paired by ``cfg_pair_id`` rather than by adjacency, because batch position
  is not stable across engine steps.
* **The decode input is not a token embedding.** After prefill, each step's
  input is the composed embedding of the previous frame's eight codes. The
  sampled ``c0`` token id still flows through vLLM's normal machinery so that
  stop handling and accounting work, but the embedding it would produce is
  replaced before the backbone runs.

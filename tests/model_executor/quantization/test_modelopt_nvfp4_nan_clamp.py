"""Tests for the NVFP4 W4A4 weight_scale NaN clamp installed by
``vllm_omni.patch``.

ModelOpt 0.44's FP32->FP8 E4M3 cast of per-block weight scales can emit
literal NaN bytes (E4M3 encoding 0x7F / 0xFF) when the pre-cast scale
rounds above the FP8 max of 448 after the global-scale division. A
single NaN byte in any per-block weight_scale collapses the FlashInfer
FP4 GEMM output to NaN and the served model emits `!!!!`. The patch
overrides ``ModelOptNvFp4LinearMethod.process_weights_after_loading``
to scan + clamp those bytes at load time.

These tests cover the behavior of the override on a synthetic layer:

- the NaN bytes get clamped to the FP8 E4M3 max byte (0x7E)
- a finite weight_scale is left untouched (no spurious writes)
- the install asserts itself so silent fallback is impossible
- the env-var escape hatch path is reachable

No GPU is required — the tests construct an in-memory FP8 ``weight_scale``
tensor with planted NaN bytes and call the patched PWAL directly.

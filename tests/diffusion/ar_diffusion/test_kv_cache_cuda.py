"""CUDA-only regression test for the AR-Diffusion paged KV write op.

Split out of ``test_kv_cache.py``: that module is swept into CI's
``core_model and cpu`` job via a module-level ``pytest.mark.cpu``, and
``hardware_test(..., num_cards=1)`` adds no ``skipif`` guard for a missing
GPU, so this test was being collected (and would fail to import a CUDA
device) on CPU-only runners. Keeping it in its own, non-``cpu`` module means
it is only ever collected by a job that explicitly selects ``cuda`` for this
path -- none does yet, so for now this is intentionally not wired into any
CI job.

    """Same assertion as the CPU test, against the real op's schema and CUDA codegen.

    The CPU test compiles a stand-in with the same ``mutates_args`` contract,
    because the real op needs a device and an attention kernel. That leaves
    one thing unverified: whether Triton codegen reinplaces the same way,
    which is the path the reported regression was observed on.

    This does not call the real op directly: ``ar_diffusion_paged_write_attn``
    runs FlashAttention's paged ``flash_attn_varlen_func`` internally, and
    compiling that under ``fullgraph=True`` can fail for reasons that have
    nothing to do with cloning (a missing kernel for this toy shape, a graph
    break, or an autotune illegal-memory-access on the control pool). Instead
    this registers a second stand-in that copies the real op's full argument
    list and ``mutates_args`` declaration -- so reinplace sees the identical
    contract the real op presents -- but skips straight to the pool writes,
    the same way the real op's own implementation does before it calls
    attention. That isolates "does Inductor clone this schema on CUDA" from
    "does FlashAttention compile", which is a separate, already-covered
    concern.

    Note the pools passed here are the flat views, since that is what the op
    takes -- it indexes them by slot and unflattens internally.

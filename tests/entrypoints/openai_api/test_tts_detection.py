"""TTS model detection: registry-driven stage -> model-type resolution.

``serving_speech.py`` used to carry a hand-written 20-branch ladder mapping
``model_stage``/``model_arch`` to a model-type string, duplicating the
``stage_keys`` every adapter already declared. Detection is now derived from the
adapters. ``test_detection_matches_legacy_ladder`` pins the new implementation
against a verbatim copy of the ladder it replaced, over every input the ladder
could distinguish, so the migration is checkable rather than reviewable-by-eye.

"""E2E tests for Qwen3-Omni ModelOpt NVFP4 W4A4 — Marlin fallback path.

Loads the published full-thinker NVFP4 W4A4 checkpoint on H100 (sm_90),
where ``init_nvfp4_linear_kernel()`` selects the ``MarlinNvFp4LinearKernel``
weight-only fallback. The Marlin kernel's PWAL casts ``weight_scale``
FP8 -> bf16 and permutes; the patched
``ModelOptNvFp4LinearMethod.process_weights_after_loading`` in
``vllm_omni.patch`` therefore clamps NaN bytes BEFORE delegating to the
original PWAL. This test asserts the served response is coherent, i.e.
no `!!!!` token cascade caused by NaN bytes in per-block ``weight_scale``.

Hardware coverage caveat: this DOES NOT exercise the native FlashInfer
FP4 GEMM (Cutlass / TRT-LLM / cuDNN) that is selected on Blackwell
sm_100+ — those kernel PWALs swizzle/shuffle FP8 bytes without dtype
casting, a different code path from Marlin. TODO(B200): add a companion
Blackwell smoke once a Blackwell runner is wired into ``tests.helpers.mark``.
